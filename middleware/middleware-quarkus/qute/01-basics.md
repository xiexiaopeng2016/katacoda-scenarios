## Create basic project

Let's create the basic Quarkus _Hello World_ application and include the necessary qute extensions. Click this command to create the project:

`mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.6.1.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=qute \
    -DclassName="org.acme.qute.HelloResource" \
    -Dextensions="quarkus-resteasy-qute,quarkus-vertx-web,quarkus-qute,quarkus-scheduler" \
    -Dpath="/hello"`{{execute T1}}

> The first time you create an app, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven and take a minute or so. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster.

This will use the Quarkus Maven Plugin and generate a basic Maven project for you in the `qute` subdirectory and include the `quarkus-resteasy-qute` extension which includes the templating engine and integration with JAX-RS via RestEasy. We've also included a few other extensions we'll use later on.

Once generated, look at the `qute/pom.xml`{{open}}. You will find the import of the Quarkus BOM, allowing to omit the version on the different Quarkus dependencies.

## Start the app

Let's begin Live Coding. Click on the following command to start the app in _Live Coding_ mode:

`cd /root/projects/quarkus/qute && \
  mvn compile quarkus:dev`{{execute T1}}

You should see:

```console
INFO  [io.qua.dep.QuarkusAugmentor] (main) Beginning quarkus augmentation
INFO  [io.qua.dep.QuarkusAugmentor] (main) Quarkus augmentation completed in 1283ms
INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Quarkus x.xx.x started in 1.988s. Listening on: http://[::]:8080
INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy, smallrye-metrics]
```
> The first time you build the app, new dependencies may be downloaded via maven. This should only happen once, after that things will go even faster.

Note the amazingly fast startup time! The app is now running "locally" (within the Linux container in which this exercise runs).

Test that the app is running by accessing the simple `hello` endpoint:

`cd /root/projects/quarkus/qute && \
  curl http://localhost:8080/hello`{{execute T2}}

> You may need to click this command again in case it doesn't execute properly on first click

you should see

```console
hello
```

## Create basic template

We’ll start with a very simple template. Create a new directory to hold our templates by clicking this command:

`mkdir -p src/main/resources/templates`{{execute T2}}

Next, click `qute/src/main/resources/templates/hello.txt`{{open}} to create the file.

Finally, click the **Copy to Editor** to add the template code:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./qute/src/main/resources/templates/hello.txt" data-target="replace">
Hello {name}!
</pre>

* `{name}` is a _value expression_ that is evaluated when the template is rendered.

> By default, all files located in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory and its
> subdirectories are registered as templates. Templates are validated during startup
> and watched for changes in the development mode.

## Create REST endpoint to access tempalte

Now let’s inject the "compiled" template in the resource class.

Click here to open `qute/src/main/java/org/acme/qute/HelloResource.java`{{open}}.

Click the **Copy to Editor** to update our `HelloResource` class:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./qute/src/main/java/org/acme/qute/HelloResource.java" data-target="replace">
package org.acme.qute;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.quarkus.qute.TemplateInstance;
import io.quarkus.qute.Template;

@Path("hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @Inject
    Template hello;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public TemplateInstance get(@QueryParam("name") String name) {
        return hello.data("name", name);
    }
}
</pre>

* If there is no `@ResourcePath` qualifier provided when `@Inject`ing, the field name is used to locate the template. In this particular case, we’re injecting a template with path `templates/hello.txt`.
* `Template.data()` returns a new template instance that can be customized before the actual rendering is triggered. In this case, we put the name value under the key `name`. The data map is accessible during rendering.
* Note that we don’t trigger the rendering - this is done automatically by a special `ContainerResponseFilter` implementation.

## Test endpoint

With our application already running in _Live Coding_ mode, we can render the template by calling the endpoint. Click the command below to test it:

`curl http://localhost:8080/hello?name=James`{{execute T2}}

You should see:

```
Hello James!
```
The template was _rendered_, replacing the `{name}` expression with the value passed in with `hello.data("name", name);`

This is the basic syntax and idea, which originated with other popular and well-known technologies:

* The [syntax](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#syntax-and-building-blocks) is mainly inspired by [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Dust.js](https://www.dustjs.com/).
* [Template inheritance](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#include_helper) is inspired by [Facelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelets) and [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/language/).
* Qute supports the [elvis operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator) you might be familiar with from [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
* [Extension methods](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#template_extension_methods) that can be used to extend the data classes with new functionality are also inspired by modern languages.
* If you come from the world of JSP/JSF/Facelets you’ll appreciate that `@Named` CDI beans can be referenced directly in any template through the `inject` namespace, e.g. `{inject:foo.price}`. See [Injecting Beans Directly In Templates](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#injecting-beans-directly-in-templates) for more information.

Let's now explore some new features based on Quarkus principles.
