In this self paced tutorial you will learn how to get started in Red Hat Fuse. This introductory service will automatically start a timer and prints out random numbers every two seconds.

## Before you get started

1. [Download Red Hat CodeReady Studio](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/download) from the Red Hat Developer program in order to access Fuse Tooling.
2. Make sure you have completed the first and second steps of the article [Hello World for Fuse Tooling via CodeReady Studio](https://developers.redhat.com/products/fuse/hello-world-fuse-tooling).

## What is Fuse

Red Hat Fuse enables developers to take an Agile Integration approach when developing solutions. By building and composing microservices, Fuse allows distributed systems deployments and a focus on scaling of services and people.

Having this hybrid capability is important as demand grows for scalable cloud native microservice APIs. To simplify the development Fuse components offer a choice of three runtimes:



* As a standalone Java application (SpringBoot)
* As a service in Apache Karaf (OSGi)
* As a service in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JavaEE)
