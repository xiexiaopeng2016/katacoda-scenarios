## What's next?

Now you are probably interested in expanding your work with Red Hat Fuse in a less structured environment. If you haven't already or if you have maybe expanding on what you have learned to build your own Red Hat Fuse applications. For hints and ideas of where to start next check out the resources below.

### Getting Started with Fuse

If you are ready for the next step take a look at this detailed guide [_"Getting Started with Fuse on OpenShift"_](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.4/html/tooling_user_guide/riderfistools). This thorough guide covers the basics from setting up the JBoss Developer suite of tools, the OpenShift CDK, and creating your first Camel project as well as more advanced topics like securing and using OpenShift to configure your applications.  **_Getting Started with Fuse on OpenShift_** covers all the basics.

### Running on different runtimes

Running on cloud looks great, but what if I want to run everything on a machine. Fuse allows you to run it on Karaf (OSGi) and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (Java EE).
