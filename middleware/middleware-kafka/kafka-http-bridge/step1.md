Deploying the bridge on OpenShift is really easy using the new KafkaBridge custom resource provided by the Red Hat AMQ Streams Cluster Operator.

### Logging in to the Cluster via OpenShift CLI

Before creating any applications, login as admin. This will be required if you want to log in to the web console and use it.

To login to the OpenShift cluster from the _Terminal_ run:

``oc login -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

This will log you in using the credentials:

* **Username:** ``developer``
* **Password:** ``developer``

Use the same credentials to log into the web console.

### Switch your own namespace

Switch to the (project) namespace called ``kafka`` where AMQ Streams Kafka Cluster Operator manages the Kafka resources, run the following command:

``oc project kafka``{{execute}}

### Deploying Kafka Bridge to your OpenShift cluster

The deployment uses a YAML file to provide the specification to create a `KafkaBridge` resource.

Click the link below to open the custom resource (CR) definition for the bridge:

* `kafka-bridge.yaml`{{open}}

The bridge has to connect to the Apache Kafka cluster. This is specified in the `bootstrapServers` property. The bridge then uses a native Apache Kafka consumer and producer for interacting with the cluster.

>For information about configuring the KafkaBridge resource, see [Kafka Bridge configuration](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.7/html-single/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/index#assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-bridge-str).

To deploy the Kafka Bridge with the custom image execute the following command:

``oc -n kafka apply -f /root/projects/http-bridge/kafka-bridge.yaml``{{execute interrupt}}

The Kafka Bridge node should be deployed after a few moments. To watch the pods status run the following command:

``oc get pods -w -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kafka-bridge``{{execute}}

You will see the pods changing the status to `running`. It should look similar to the following:

```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
my-bridge-bridge-6b6d9f785c-dp6nk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s
my-bridge-bridge-6b6d9f785c-dp6nk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          12s
my-bridge-bridge-6b6d9f785c-dp6nk   0/1     Running             0          27s
my-bridge-bridge-6b6d9f785c-dp6nk   1/1     Running             0          45s
```

`^C`{{execute ctrl-seq}}

### Creating an OpenShift route

After deployment, the AMQ Streams Kafka Bridge can only be accessed by applications running in the same OpenShift cluster. If you want to make the Kafka Bridge accessible to applications running outside of the OpenShift cluster, you can expose it manually by using one of the following features:

* Services of types LoadBalancer or NodePort
* Ingress resources
* OpenShift routes

An **OpenShift route** is an OpenShift resource for allowing external access via HTTP/HTTPS to internal services, like the HTTP bridge. We will use this approach for our example.

Run the following comand to expose the bridge service as an OpenShift route:

``oc expose svc my-bridge-bridge-service``{{execute interrupt}}

When the route is created, the AMQ Streams Kafka Bridge is reacheable through the `https://my-bridge-bridge-service-kafka.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com` host, so you can use any HTTP client to interact with the REST API exposed by the bridge for sending and receiving messages without the requirement to use the native Kafka protocol.
