Congratulations!  You just finished learning how to deploy your own JBoss Fuse Integration Service to OpenShift. Pretty simple isn't it?

## What's next?

Now you are probably interested in expanding your work with OpenShift in a less structured environment. You can start with setting up your own OpenShift environment if you haven't already or if you have maybe expanding on what you have learned to build your own JBoss FIS 2.0 applications. For hints and ideas of where to start next check out the resources below.

### Getting Started with Fuse Integration Services

If you are ready for the next step take a look at this detailed guide [_"Getting Started with Fuse Integration Services"_](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/tooling_user_guide/riderfistools). This thorough guide covers the basics from setting up the JBoss Developer suite of tools, the OpenShift CDK, and creating your first Camel project as well as more advanced topics like securing and using OpenShift to configure your applications.  **_Getting Started with Fuse Integration Services_** covers all the basics.
