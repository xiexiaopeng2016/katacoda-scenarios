## Goal

Learn how to use [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) on OpenShift to collect metrics from an application and then visualize the results with [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

## Concepts

* Prometheus, exporters, and application metrics
* Grafana charts and graphs
* OpenShift Web Console
* `oc` OpenShift command line tool

## Use case

You can analyze application metrics to spot problems, monitor performance, audit resource use, and improve your understanding of your application's behavior in order to improve it.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
