That is it for this workshop.

If you are interested in digging further into specific topics around using OpenShift, see the home page of our [OpenShift interactive learning portal](https://learn.openshift.com).

There are exercises for understanding the fundamentals of using OpenShift, but also how to deploy applications using Red Hat middleware products.

Finally, if you just want to play around, and perhaps try deploying your own application, you can use the playground environments.
