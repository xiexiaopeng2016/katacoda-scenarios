In this course you learned about deploying an application from source code using a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder. You first deployed the application from the web console, following that up with using the command line. You also learnt about using binary input source builds to run builds using source code from a local directory on your own computer.

The web application you deployed was implemented using the Python programming language. OpenShift provides S2I builders for a number of different programming languages/frameworks in addition to Python. These include Java, NodeJS, Perl, PHP and Ruby.
