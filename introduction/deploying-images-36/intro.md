When using OpenShift there are a number of different ways you can add an application. The main methods are:

* Deploy an application from an existing Docker-formatted image.
* Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository using a Source-to-Image builder.
* Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository from a Dockerfile.

In this course you will learn how to deploy an application from an existing
Docker-formatted image using the OpenShift web console, and from the command
line using ``oc``.
