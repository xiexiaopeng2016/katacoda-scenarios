Congratulations! You just finished learning the basics of how to get started with the OpenShift Container Platform. Feels good doesn't it?

## What's next?

At this point you are probably itching to keep working with OpenShift as you have had a glimpse of the power this can bring to your own applications. We are currently working on more advanced tutorials that will be hosted here but in the meantime, you can certainly run your own version of OpenShift or use a hosted model. You are welcome to use one of the following options:

### Minishift

Minishift is a complete OpenShift environment that you can run on your local machine. The project supports Windows, OS X, and the Linux operating system.  To find more about minishift, visit https://www.okd.io/minishift/

### OpenShift Online

The OpenShift team provides a hosted environment which includes a free starter plan which you can use to develop and test applications for OpenShift. You can find details for OpenShift Online and sign up at https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing/

### OpenShift Dedicated

You can also let Red Hat host an OpenShift instance for you on a public cloud. This is an ideal scenario for larger teams that doesn't want to deal with the operational aspects or running a full environment. To find out more, visit https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/
